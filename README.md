# NBA_Player_Comparision
Did you know that last year, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had almost the same amount of points, rebounds and assists as superstar Steph Curry? Help my bot unearth more comparisons like this with the NBA Player Comparison tool.

### Description
The NBA Player Comparison website and Twitter bot work together to produce quality tweets that show surpisngly similar players. Follow @c_swish_stats on Twitter to see the bot in action.

### Under the hood
This project uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) to show potentially interesting comparisons to users.  These comparisons are generated by querying player statistics from the 2021-2022 NBA season. On the website users vote on which player comparisons are interesting. The interesting pairs are stored in MongoDB and periodically tweeted out on @c_swish_stats (give it a follow!) Soon the web application will be deployed to the cloud so it can be visited 24/7, stay tuned.
