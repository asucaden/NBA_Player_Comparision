# NBA_Player_Comparision
Did you know that last year, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had almost the same amount of points, rebounds and assists as superstar Steph Curry? Unearth this comparison, and many more examples of players with similar stats, but different levels of fame.

## Description
The NBA Player Comparison website and Twitter bot work together to produce quality tweets that show suprisngly similar players. Follow @c_swish_stats on Twitter to see the bot in action.

## Under the hood
This project uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) to show potentially interesting comparisons to users on the website, then lets the user vote on which player comparisons are interesting. The interesting pairs are stored in MongoDB and periodically tweeted out on @c_swish_stats. Soon the web application will be deployed to the cloud so it can be visited 24/7, stay tuned!
